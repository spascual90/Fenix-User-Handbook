# Using Auto Mode

## Engaging the autopilot \(Auto mode\) 

1. Steady the boat on the required heading.
2. Place the pushrod over the tiller pin. If necessary, extend or retract the pushrod using the -1, +1, -10, and +10 keys. 
3. Press auto: the tiller pilot will enter Auto mode and the display will show an ‘A’ \(for auto\) alongside the locked autopilot heading. 

## Disengaging the autopilot \(Standby mode\) 

To return to hand steering:

1. Press standby. 
2. Remove the pushrod from the tiller pin to return to hand steering: the display will show a flashing ‘C’ and the boat’s current compass heading.
3. The last heading is memorized and can be recalled \(see page 10\)

## Changing course

In Auto mode, 

use the -1 and -10 \(port\) and +1 and +10 \(starboard\) keys to change course in steps of 1° and 10°.

For example: press -10 three times for a 30° course change to port:

## Automatic tack feature \(AutoTack\)

Feature not available in v.0.1

## Dodging obstacles

To avoid an obstacle when you boat is under autopilot control, 

1. select a course change in the appropriate direction. For example, press -10 three times for a 30°dodge to port.
2. When safely clear of the obstacle, you can either:

* [x] reverse the previous course change \(for example, by pressing +10 three times\), or
* [x] return to the previous heading \(see below\)

## Returning to the previous heading

1. Press auto for 1 second: the previous heading will flash for 10 seconds.
2. To accept the previous heading, press auto again while the previous heading is flashing.

Note: If you do not press auto while the display is flashing, the autopilot will maintain the current heading. 
{% endhint %}

## Off course alarm

The off course alarm sounds if the locked autopilot heading and the boat’s current heading differ by more than the value set in calibration level 6 \(see page 62\) for 20 seconds.

### Cancelling the off course alarm

To cancel the off course alarm, 

1. press standby to return to manual steering. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If the off course alarm sounds, this is usually an indication that the boat is carrying too much sail, or that the sails are badly balanced. In these conditions, you can usually obtain significant improvements in course keeping by improving the sail balance

## Automatic deadband control \(Auto Seastate\)

In Auto, WindTrim or Track modes, the tiller pilot is set to AutoSeastate \(automatic deadband control\) as a default. This causes the pilot to gradually ignore repetitive movements of the boat and respond only to true course variations. 

By preventing unnecessary rudder movement, AutoSeastate provides the best compromise between power consumption and course keeping accuracy. 

If you want to switch off the AutoSeastate feature: 

1. From Auto, WindTrim or Track mode, press -1 and +1 together to switch from AutoSeastate to Fixed Minimum Deadband.
2. The “°” sign flashes when Fixed Minimum Deadband is selected. Minimum deadband provides the tightest course keeping possible, at the expense of increased power consumption and drive unit activity.

To switch back to AutoSeastate, press -1 and +1 again.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The autopilot reverts to Automatic Deadband Control each time you select Standby mode
