# Commissioning

## Commissioning Process

This chapter explains how to commission your tiller pilot after installation. This consists of a number of simple functional tests followed by a short sea trial.

Before first use of Fenix Autopilot, user shall go through the complete Commissioning process.

## Functional tests

#### Switch on

1. Switch on the main power breaker.

2. The autopilot should beep and display the pilot number \(ST1000 or ST2000\). 

3. Within 2 seconds, the display should show a flashing ‘C’ followed by the compass heading \(for example, C 234\). 

This shows the autopilot is active. Note: If the tiller pilot does not beep or display the compass heading, please refer to the Fault Finding section \(see page 26\).

#### Operating sense

The operating sense defines the direction the tiller pilot will apply helm when a course change key is pressed or the boat goes off course. To check the operating sense:

1. Place the pushrod end over the tiller pin.

2. Press +10.

3. The helm should move to produce a turn to starboard

If the helm produces a turn to port, refer to the following instructions on reversing the operating sense.
